Just shoot for the stars
If it feels right and aim for my heart
If you feel like
And take me away and make it okay
I swear I'll behave
You wanted control, so we waited
I put on a show, now I make it
You say I'm a kid
My ego is big
I don't give a shit
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves, like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves, like Jagger
Baby, it's hard, and it feels like
You're broken and scarred, nothing feels right
But when you're with me
I'll make you believe
That I've got the key
Oh, so get in the car, we can ride it
Wherever you want, get inside it
And you want to steer
But I'm shifting gears
I'll take it from here (Oh, yeah, yeah)
And it goes like this (Uh)
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Uh)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you
Want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
I don't need to try to control you (Oh, yeah)
Look into my eyes and I'll own you
With them moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger (Yeah yeah)
I've got the moves like Jagger
You wanna know, how to make me smile?
Take control, own me just for the night
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this
So watch and learn, I won't show you twice
Head to toe, ooh baby, rub me right
And if I share my secret
You're gonna have to keep it
Nobody else can see this (Ay, ay, ay, ay!)
And it goes like this
Take me by the tongue and I'll know you (Take me by the tongue)
Kiss me 'til you're drunk and I'll show you (Yeah yeah yeah!)
You want the moves like Jagger
I've got the moves like Jagger
